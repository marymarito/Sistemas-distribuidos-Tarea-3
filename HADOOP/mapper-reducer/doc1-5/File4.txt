== Playing career ==
Liu Yue would start his career with Shandong Luneng and would quickly make a name for himself when he was part of the team that won the 1995 Chinese FA Cup. This would soon see him selected for the Chinese national team where he was selected as the team's first choice left back within the 1996 Asian Cup. Within the tournament he would have a disappointing game against Saudi Arabia within the quarter-finals, which saw China knocked out of the competition and ending his international career once the manager Qi Wusheng permanently drop him from the team. Despite this Liu would continue to be a regular for Shandong and go on to win the 1999 league title and FA Cup with them before moving to Yunnan Hongta F.C. where he was reunited with his former coach Qi Wusheng. After spending several seasons with Yunnan the club were taken over by Chongqing Lifan F.C. where he spent one season with them before retiring.
